# SQL_Engeto
Repo for my learning course project

The goal of this project was to practise sql syntax and  data manipulation on real world dataset.
The data was comprised of records of wages across different industries, food prices and economical indicators over the span of several years.
Given this information I was able to compare growth of individual industry wage relative to each other, their buying power in respect to food prices and observe the impact of GPD changes on the prices, buying power and wages.
